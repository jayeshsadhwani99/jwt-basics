## Introduction to JWT

**JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** offer a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

## Implementing JWT in Node.js

Install the necessary package:

```bash
npm install jsonwebtoken
```

**Creating JWTs:**

```javascript
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
const user = { id: 1, username: "john.doe" };
const accessToken = jwt.sign({ user: user.id }, "yourSecretKey", {
  expiresIn: "1h",
});
```

**Verifying JWTs:**

```javascript
const decoded = jwt.verify(token, "yourSecretKey");
```

## Frontend Token Handling

**Storing Tokens Securely:**

Cookies should be set with the `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` attributes to enhance security.

**Handling Token Expiry:**

Automatically refresh tokens upon detecting expired access tokens during API requests.

## Security Best Practices

### Preventing XSS Attacks

XSS attacks involve injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Sanitize Input:**

Ensure all user input is sanitized before being rendered on the page. This can be done using libraries like `DOMPurify`.

```javascript
const clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty);
```

**Content Security Policy (CSP):**

Implement CSP to prevent XSS attacks by specifying which resources can be executed or loaded.

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://apis.example.com
```

### Mitigating CSRF Attacks

CSRF attacks trick a user into executing unwanted actions on a web application where they're authenticated.

**SameSite Cookie Attribute:**

Set the `SameSite` attribute to `Strict` or `Lax` to prevent the browser from sending cookies with cross-site requests.

```javascript
res.cookie("token", "YOUR_JWT", {
  sameSite: "Strict",
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: true,
});
```

**Anti-CSRF Tokens:**

Include a unique token in requests that change the server state. Verify this token server-side with each submission.

```html
<input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="UNIQUE_TOKEN" />
```

**Verifying Origin with Standard Headers:**

Check the `Origin` and `Referer` headers in server-side code to ensure requests are coming from your application.

```javascript
if (req.headers.origin !== "https://yourapp.com") {
  res.status(403).send("CSRF detected");
}
```

### Secure Token Transmission and Storage

**Use HTTPS:**

Ensure all communications are over HTTPS to protect token integrity and confidentiality.

**Short-Lived Tokens:**

Implement short-lived access tokens and use refresh tokens to extend sessions securely.

```javascript
const accessToken = jwt.sign({ user: user.id }, "accessSecret", {
  expiresIn: "15m",
});
const refreshToken = jwt.sign({ user: user.id }, "refreshSecret", {
  expiresIn: "7d",
});
```

## Conclusion

Adopting these security best practices in your JWT implementation safeguards your application against common web vulnerabilities. By understanding and applying these measures, developers can build more secure and robust applications.
